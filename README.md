## ðŸ“‚ **Stage 0 : Problem Statement**
### Problem Statement
- In the multifinance industry, effective credit risk management is essential to prevent financial losses and enhance profitability. High Non-Performing Loan (NPL) rates can disrupt financial stability and impact business decisions. By leveraging seven years of historical loan data, companies can improve the accuracy of credit risk assessments and predict default probabilities more effectively.

- The available data indicates that approximately 89.07% of loans are classified as good loans, while 10.93% fall into the bad loan category. Although the percentage of bad loans is relatively small, it still poses significant risks, warranting deeper analysis.

- The Probability of Default (PD) is a powerful method for accurately predicting credit risk. Utilizing PD allows companies to identify risk factors, optimize credit decisions, mitigate potential losses, and increase profitability.- 


### Goals
- Develop a Probability of Default (PD) model to predict loan defaults and support more accurate credit decision-making.


### Objectives
- Build a reliable and accurate machine learning-based PD model.
- Identify key factors influencing loan defaults to facilitate better decision-making.

### Business Matrics
-  Probability of Default (PD)

### Data Preprocessing Summary:

1. Feature Removal:
- Drop columns with >70% missing values.
- Exclude identifiers (e.g., id, id anggota, url, etc.).
- Remove sub_grade (duplicates information from grade).
- Exclude future-related features (e.g., next_pymnt_d, recovery, etc.).

2. Loan Status Classification:
- Bad Loans (1): Charged Off, Default, Late (31-120 days), Late (16-30 days), Does not meet the credit policy. Status: Charged Off.
- Good Loans (0): Fully Paid, Current, In Grace Period, Does not meet the credit policy. Status: Fully Paid.

3. Target Variable Creation:
- Create a binary variable: good (0) and bad (1) loans.

The heatmap highlights significant correlations among payment variables, such as total_rec_int with total_pymnt (0.60) and last_pymnt_amnt with total_pymnt (0.64). Weak correlations exist between loan_bad and variables like annual_inc (0.04, positive), dti (-0.06), and int_rate (-0.17, both negative), suggesting minimal influence on default risk. Most other features show low, likely insignificant correlations.

Data distribution is imbalanced, with most features highly skewed and concentrated in specific ranges, alongside notable outliers. The target variable, loan_bad, also shows class imbalance, requiring adjustments for effective classification modeling.

The Logistic Regression model shows a robust performance with an ROC AUC of 0.858 on both the cross-validation training and test sets. This suggests that the model performs consistently well in distinguishing between classes across different thresholds of probability, despite some imbalance in the data. The ROC AUC score indicates a good trade-off between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).

## ðŸ“‚ **Stage 6 : Model Evaluation**

- Gini = (roc_auc * 2) - 1
- Gini : 0.701925

Reliable Predictive Performance
With an ROC-AUC of 0.850963, the model demonstrates exceptional performance in distinguishing between Bad Loan and Good Loan. It proves to be highly reliable in predicting default risk.

Strong Gini Coefficient
A Gini value of 0.701925 indicates the model's effectiveness in separating positive and negative classes. This serves as a strong indicator of the model's predictive power, even in the presence of imbalanced data.

## ðŸ“‚ **Stage 7 : Recommendation and Conclution**

A. Based on the best Logistic Regression model, here are the recommendations for managing loan credit:
1. Total Payment (total_pymnt): Focus on high-paying customers. Offer incentives like discounts or special promos for those paying over 22,000.
2. Total Interest Received (total_rec_int): Tailor approaches for customers with high interest income. Offer premium product access to those with more than 9,000.
3. Outstanding Loan Balance (out_prncp): Review policies for customers with small balances. For balances under 3,000, offer more flexible repayment options.
4. Interest Rate (int_rate): Provide attractive offers for customers with low-interest rates, such as further financing or refinancing options.

B. Model Analysis: 
- The Logistic Regression model shows a portfolio consisting of 61.13% good loans and 38.87% risky loans. 15.01% of good loans are invested. For every 100 loans avoided, 97.95% are risky (98 risky and 2 good loans).
